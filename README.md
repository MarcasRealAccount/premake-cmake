# premake-cmake
To use this add this repo to the one of the [search paths](https://premake.github.io/docs/Locating-Scripts).  
Then add the following inside `premake-system.lua`:
```lua
require("premake-cmake")
```

You can clone directly into one of the search paths, or alternatively clone to another path and make a symlink to it.
